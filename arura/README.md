WhatsApp Annoyng Bot Project

Version 1.0
	-Here comes the new improvment list
	-For now, existing is a good improvment

Project description
	This is the semiautomatic whhataspp bot, made to send as many messagesn as you want to as many of your contacts as you bother to write, based on WhatsApp Web running in browser, browsers wich can be managed with selenium lib.
	All this code is made in python and its first version is procedural, meanig that I had no ideia what does OOP was at the time.
	The bot is semiautomatic because whatsapp web has to be sincronized by decoding a QR Code with the WhatsApp App, thus requiring the user to manually scan with their phones.
	It aims to be able to send an user input number of messages out of as many pre written user input messages set. Then the script will send akk this messages to a list of contacts pre written by the user. Yet, it looks for conversations with the name corresponding to the exact text written by the user


Installation
	it will have a requirements.txt, its own enviroment to ease the instalation process, a guide to iniciate the virtualenv to instal its required libraries 

Quickstart
	An step by step to see the script running

Improvments on the sight
	-Ability to chose the best browser in the user machine
	-Ability to seek for a response to interrupt message packege
	-Ability to check if there is a contact referent to the name given to the script, maybe retrieve the complete chat list, than to validate if the name given correspond to any existente chat
	-Timer or loading bar to give the user an estimate of completion time/progression, there's no way of knowing how many messages remain
